# generative-drawings

Code allows us draw in ways that aren't possible in other mediums. It allows us to create images from simple rules that deliver beautiful results.
Code can compute and draw many elements consistently, incorporate randomness, and allow interaction; aspects hard to achieve through other mediums.
